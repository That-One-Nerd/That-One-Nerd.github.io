            <p>I value your privacy. I get it. Personally, I would rather not be tracked across every page I go to or have a company know more about me than I do myself. It's not a good look on the site. Maybe it's just me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now I know that that's something often lied about. But seriously, the list of things I collect is going to be so short and mundane it might even be a little boring. The site does use cookies, however, for simple things also described down below. If you really hate every cookie to ever exist, you can opt out. But these cookies I think you'll agree are nothing you should get mad about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy" id="global">
            <h2>Things collected for global usage.</h2>
            <p>This is the data I collect from your browsing session that is sent to the servers for safe-keeping.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nothing (maybe one day anonymous page statistics).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy" id="cookies">
            <h2>Things stored locally on your computer (cookies).</h2>
            <p>You've probably heard of cookies. But if you haven't, cookies are basically little bits of data stored on your computer. Only the website that puts a cookie on your computer can look at that cookie. It was created as a quality-of-life improvement to keep track of things like light/dark mode, or your login credentials so you don't have to sign in every time you refresh. Cookies aren't inheritly bad, they have only recently been taken and used improperly for things like tracking.</p>
            <p>So here's what I store with cookies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether to show or hide the header.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy" id="intro">
            <p>That's everything.</p>
            <p>And I'm not lying, if you are a programming nerd (like me) then you can feel free to view the source code of the website and check for yourself. I'll even help you find the files that matter.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can find all of the source files on the GitHub Pages repository <a href="https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/That-One-Nerd.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="/js/global.js" target="_blank">global.js</a> is a big one. You may also want to look at the page-specific JavaScript files.</li>
                <li><a href="/js/lib/extras.js" target="_blank">extras.js</a> and <a href="/js/lib/lerping.js" target="_blank">lerping.js</a> are just extra tools.</li>
                <li><a href="/js/imports.js" target="_blank">imports.js</a> is literally just used for importing the above files. There should never be any complicated code there.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In fact, if you find anything that looks suspicious, please message me to let me know. It might be some sort of hack, or I might just have changed how much I value your privacy, in which case please hold me personally accountable.</p>
