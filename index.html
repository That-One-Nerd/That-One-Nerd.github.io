                    Hey there, I'm Kyle, and I'm 14 years old. I am a programmer and game developer as a hobby. I've been programming in Unity and C# for about 2 years now, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Most of my games will be free, because I don't need the money. I'm just here to make games that I would enjoy playing myself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also make things other than games, like this website. This is my first successful website I made myself. No website generator this time, all the raw HTML and CSS. I'm also learning other languages right now, such as Java, C++, and Python.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Also, FYI, all URLs on this website have a little underline to show you, and they open in a new tab. And no suspicious links. I don't want this site getting grouped up with other non-trustworthy sites. No ads here, either. Have fun.
                </p>

        <div class = "formattable whatido">
            <h2>What kind of stuff do I do?</h2>
            <p>
                Whatever I feel like. Usually, some sort of new game, but I'll also work on other things, like libraries and other tools. I've recently gained interest in graphics programming (basically doing what Unity does myself). I've began learning OpenCV and OpenGL, but I'm not as good at that kind of stuff as my buddy <a href = "https://about.saalty.net/" target = "_blank">Saalty</a>, so credit for that goes to him.

                I'll try to make any library I use myself, because I'm the kind of person that likes to re-invent the wheel. But I understand their use, and for more complicated things like <a href = "https://www.newtonsoft.com/json" target = "_blank">Json.Net</a> I won't try and recreate. For now. :)

            <h2>Want to hire me?</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I'm not up for full-on jobs yet, I'll wait a few more years first. But, if any company looking here is up for an internship in software development, I might be interested. You can email me at <a href = "mailto:dev@thatonenerd.net" target = "_blank">dev@thatonenerd.net</a>.
            
                Employers, you can also check out my <a href = "about.html">About Me</a> page for more information.
