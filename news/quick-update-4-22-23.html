                I know it's a bit late, but happy new year!

                I just wanted to make an announcement that I've made a small update to the project
                pages. Recreating them takes forever, especially for some of the more complex ones,
                so I've instead just made the pages redirect to their itch page equivalents (for
                Nerd_STF, the page redirects to GitHub). I have also recreated the Trick or Treat
                page just FYI.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're really obsessed with random stuff that doesn't matter, you might have
                noticed a new page about Hackathons on the website. I won't give the link
                because <i>it literally doesn't matter</i> but if you're really insistant you can
                find it in the GitHub repository. I just added that because of a club I have at my
                school. It will likely be deleted in the near future.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all I've got for now. Quick, right?
            </p>
