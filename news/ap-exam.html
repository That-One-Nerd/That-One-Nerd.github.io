            <p>
                Not sure if it's obvious or not, but I enjoy computer science. It's my thing.
                So I'm in some computer science classes at my school, and guess when the AP
                exam for one of them is? I mean, if you saw the home page, I guess you already
                know. It's on the third of May at 12:00 PM Eastern Time. Now, I hear many of you
                asking, "Why should I care?"
            </p>
            <p>
                You have no reason to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, that's basically all I have to say. Probably shouldn't have made a
                full-scale news page for this, but here we are.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's everything. Goodbye.
            </p>
