                    Hey there. I'm Kyle. I am %age% years old and I like to program as a hobby.
                    <br><br>
                    I've been programming for almost %start% years now, right at the start of Covid-19, and it was love at first sight. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
                    <br><br>
                    I originally started with the programming language C#, but since then I've spread to other languages, namely C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="field" id="interests">
            <p>I love software development and logical thinking. Some fields I have an interest in are (in no particular order):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Graphical programming (not to be confused with graphic design)</li>
                <li>General algorithm development</li>
                <li>Library development</li>
                <li>Game development</li>
                <li>Server and website development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's how I'd rate my programming skills</p>
            <img id="skills-img" src="images/about/programmingskills.png">
            <div id="skills-float">
                <div id="skills-float-left">
                    <p>Beginner</p>
                </div>
                <div id="skills-float-right">
                    <p>Expert</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I'm definitely no expert (compared to some serious computer scientists I look up to), but I'd say I'm past the Intermediate stage. Somewhere in the middle of those two.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="field" id = "what-ive-done">
            <p>Here's some noteworthy stuff I've done:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created and maintained <a href="https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/Nerd_STF" target="_blank">Nerd_STF</a> as a solo project.</li>
                <li>Created <a href="https://that-one-nerd.itch.io/trick-or-treat" target="_blank">Trick Or Treat</a>, <a href="https://that-one-nerd.itch.io/rebuild">Rebuild</a>, and some other small Itch games.</li>
                <li>Developing Brigade Laboratories, a game that I'm staying mostly secretive about. <a href="/projects/brigadelabs.html">Learn More</a></li>
            </ul>

            <br><br><br><br><br>

            <p>I like to reinvent the wheel in software development. For example, Nerd_STF. I know there is a bunch in Nerd_STF that already exists in a different library, and it's likely better. But I feel like doing it myself teaches me more than just using somebody else's code. I wouldn't have learned nearly as much if I just used a different library.</p>
